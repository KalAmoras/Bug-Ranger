# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

A typical bug tracker, also known as an issue tracking system, is designed to help software development teams manage and track bugs, feature requests, and other issues throughout the software development lifecycle. While different bug trackers may have varying features and capabilities, here are some common fields you would typically find in a bug tracker:

Issue ID/Number: A unique identifier for each issue.

Title/Summary: A concise description of the issue.

Description/Details: A more detailed explanation of the problem or request.

Priority: The importance or urgency assigned to the issue (e.g., high, medium, low).

Severity: The impact or seriousness of the issue (e.g., critical, major, minor).

Status: The current state of the issue (e.g., open, assigned, in progress, closed).

Assignee: The person or team responsible for resolving the issue.

Reporter: The person who reported or identified the issue.

Date Created: The date when the issue was initially reported.

Last Updated: The date and time of the last modification or update to the issue.

Steps to Reproduce: Detailed instructions or steps to reproduce the problem.

Expected Behavior: The expected outcome or behavior when the issue is resolved.

Actual Behavior: The observed or current behavior of the software.

Attachments: Any relevant files, screenshots, or supporting documents related to the issue.

Comments/Notes: Additional information, discussions, or updates related to the issue.

Related Issues/Links: Links or references to other related issues or documents.

Component/Module: The specific area or module of the software where the issue is located.

Version/Release: The version or release of the software in which the issue was found.

Environment: Information about the hardware, operating system, and software environment where the issue occurred.

Labels/Tags: Categorization or tags to help classify and filter issues (e.g., bug, feature request, enhancement).


These fields provide a basic framework for managing and tracking issues within a bug tracker, but depending on the bug tracker's features and customization options, additional fields may be available to cater to specific needs and workflows of the development team.
